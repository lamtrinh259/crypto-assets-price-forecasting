# Crytp assets price forecasting
This repository contains my codes that was submitted as part of a Kaggle competition that is live until May 2022 to forecast the returns on 14 different crypto assets. More information about the competition can be [viewed here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting)

My notebook can be viewed here below. I developed 2 different versions (both were forked from a Kaggle grandmaster's model, credit is given where it's due) and submit them for the final evaluation: 
1. Baseline model: [Catboost model with CV](https://www.kaggle.com/lamtrinh259/g-research-catboost-model-cv)
2. Improved and final model: [LSTM model](https://www.kaggle.com/lamtrinh259/g-research-crypto-lstm)

In the near future, I plan to develop a lighter (in terms of memory) and easier-to-modify notebook. After the model is modified, I will deploy the final version on a hosted server where users can choose the coin they want to get forecast for.
